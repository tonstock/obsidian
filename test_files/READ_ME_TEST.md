To run tests:
1. Call deno test [specific_file.ts] to run tests on that file
2. Call deno test [folder] to run all test files in that folder (test files match the pattern '*test.ts')

One challenge is how do we test functionality that is not exported?
In Node, we can use a package called reqire.
In Deno, this package does not currently exist.

Some possible workarounds:
1. export everything (bad practice, exposes a ton of functionality that probably shouldn't be exposed)
2. create a test environment that exports all functions when in test - see second ranked answer

3. port rewire into Deno, lol

With Rhum:
To run all tests enter deno test [file_directory] --allow-env
